So after two weeks of reconsidering my business idea, following several fruitless conversations with receptionists and PAs filtering calls to the people I really want to engage with, I have decided to put Sense Care on hold and pursue another idea to take through the PSA course! This is by no means a change of heart, I really believe in Sense Care and what I want to achieve but think I need the experience of a successful startup in order to give me leverage and a foot in, and need a better strategy for b2b marketing.

So after an epic few days of mental wrangling I have decided to change my mission…. my mission now is to help new parents with children under 2 to have confidence in public and freedom in the community because parents should feel confident enough to go out so that they can improve the moods of themselves and their children and enjoy their time together.

So I spent a week writing my story and doing some market research with parents I believe to be my target customer.  My story essentially is the following:

I had my son almost six months ago, and I remember the fear that overwhelmed me when I thought about leaving the house with him and all the challenges that may arise.  I remember feeling completely out of my depth, not knowing where I could go and even how to get myself together to leave the house! The first time I ventured out alone I met a friend at a cafe and apologetically asked the waitress if I could breastfeed my son.  As time has gone on I quickly got my mojo back and was whipping out my breast on demand to feed my hungry baby! I was navigating my way around shopping centres, getting stuck into buggy wars on buses and meandering through busy supermarkets! And loving every moment! When I look back I laugh at the quivering sleep deprived mess I was! For some it takes a little longer to emerge from the zombie like haze….some are possibly never the same again!! Whatever your story, most can identify or know of someone that has experienced some discomfort or struggle with venturing out with a new baby!

When you have a baby you shouldn’t stop doing the things you love.  You may have to change your perception but fun and babies don’t have to be mutually exclusive!

Following several iterations and feedback from fellow entrepreneurs and my ideal customer I plan to create a mobile application that helps parents to find their nearest baby friendly venue.
