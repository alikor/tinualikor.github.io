It's an overwhelming, but reassuring feeling when you know what you need to do but have no idea how to do it! Following a nice break with the family on a hunt for Winnie the Pooh and a beautiful double wedding, its back to work!

So where do I start?

My mission is to help new parents with children under 2 to have confidence in public and freedom in the community because parents should feel confident enough to go out so that they can improve the moods of themselves and their children and enjoy their time together.

It is an easy to use mobile application that enables parents to find their nearest baby friendly venue, giving them confidence to go out and enjoy time away from home with their child.
The app is  a refuge for parents holding on to their independence, confidence and passion for socialising and enjoying good food and company with their children.  Parents who embrace indulgence and teething gel, an aperitif and aspirator, heels and hiccups, music and muslins.  Life continues with parenthood

So I'm creating a mobile application called Baby Point! Hopefully one day Baby Point will be a household name and its logo will be symbolic of a venues attitude towards parents and children!  It's all well and good looking for your local baby group or even stay and play venue, but sometimes you just want to have a cup of tea overlooking the Thames or have some Sushi in Soho....so what do you do then?? You could just venture out and cross your fingers! You could call before hand and hope that you get a coherent human being on the other end and ask them a series of questions....or you could just launch Baby Point! Or that's the plan! Baby Points at your finger tips.  It will tell you if the venue has changing facilities, will give you hot water for your baby's formula, high five you for breastfeeding (perhaps not literally), has high chairs and food for children.  It plans to be the go to for parents.  Users can input Baby Points and businesses can also ensure they have a presence on the platform.  What's in it for you? That warm feeling knowing that you're helping other parents get out and about with their kids and the obvious street cred that will undoubtedly become synonymous with you

I feel like I'm in a chicken and egg scenario, the app needs businesses to sign up to become a Baby Point but also needs users to make the app an appealing option for businesses.  I've been knocking on a few doors and had amazing feedback so far. I think its strategy time!
