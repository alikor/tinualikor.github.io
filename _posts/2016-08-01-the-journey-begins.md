This is the beginning of the my story, the first page of what I hope to be the chapter that births my new beginning.  What has inspired this?? Life, and love….I am the proud new mother of my son Joshua.  All 16 weeks of motherhood have been a fierce combination of emotions, sleep deprivation, intimate beauty, overwhelmed with joy.  A journey that has created an abundance of hope, unrivalled love and a desire to be the best I can…

Which leads me to my journey of self discovery and achievement.  I want Joshua to be proud of me, motherhood has revived my fierce independence and desire to give him the best start in life I can.  

So here I am, beginning my adventure into the unknown…. by way of a brief introduction, I married the love of my life, Madu an accomplished and passionate polygot developer just over a year ago.  He has slowly encouraged me to dip my pedicured pinky into the world of technology and although initially reluctant it was almost inevitable.  My background is legal, but my true passion is people.  While pregnant, I started to build on my foundations by learning about agile project management and am now a certified practitioner and Scrum Master.  I am keen to follow the Lean methodology in my business and am currently on maternity leave, embarking on a career change to follow my dreams of being a full time entrepreneur.  

Which brings me to the present. I have taken a leap of faith and enrolled on two courses, one with a Startup called Mums in Tech, a wonderful group of like minded women who complete a 6 week course to learn the basics of computer programming.  The second is called the Parentpreneur Startup Accelerator, a course that basically helps parents become entrepreneurs and find balance with family life.  So here I am, following a feed with my son at 0300 writing my first blog post! I am excited about this journey and looking forward to sharing the highs and lows with you.  I am all in….destination unknown, but happy.  I am inspired to change my life and those around me for the better and am willing to get dirty doing it….so here goes!
